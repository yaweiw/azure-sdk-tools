## Configure PowerShell to automatically load commandlets

1. Create a folder inside your user's Documents folder and name it __WindowsPowerShell__

2. Inside that folder create a file called __Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1__

3. Edit the file in a text editor and add the following contents

   ```Import-Module PATH_TO_AZURE-SDK-TOOLS_CLONE\Package\Release\Azure.psd1```

4. After you build the commandlets project, you can then open a PowerShell window and you should be able to use the commandlets. Please note that if you want to rebuild the project, you have close the PowerShell window, and then reopen it.

# Quick start

1. Create an Azure hosted service called HelloWorld by typing

   ```New-AzureServiceProject HelloWorld```

2. Inside the HelloWorld folder, add a new Web Role by typing

   ```Add-AzureNodeWebRole``` or ```Add-AzurePHPWebRole```

3. Test out the application in the local emulator by typing

   ```Start-AzureEmulator -Launch```

4. You are now ready to publish to the cloud service. Go ahead and register for a Windows Azure account and make sure you have your credentials handy.

5. Get your account's publish settings and save them to a file by typing ```Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile```

6. Now import the settings

   ```Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE```

7. You are now ready to publish to the cloud. Make sure you specify a unique name for your application to ensure there aren't any conflicts during the publish process. Then type

   ```Publish-AzureServiceProject -ServiceName UNIQUE_NAME -Launch```
